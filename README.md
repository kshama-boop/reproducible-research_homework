## Question 4

#### Question 4a

The trajectories of the two random walks generated by the provided script show irregular paths that change over time. Each path is unique and progresses differently due to the inherent randomness involved in generating steps. One plot shows a trajectory that moves predominantly along the positive x-axis, while the other plot remains closer to the origin and spreads more along the y-axis.

The paths are colored using a gradient that transitions from dark blue to light blue, representing time progression. As time increases, the paths diverge farther from the starting point, although the exact extent and direction differ due to the randomness in the process. These characteristics reflect the stochastic nature of the random walk model.

#### Question 4b

A random seed is a value used to initialise the random number generator. The random number generator requires an initial value, known as the seed, to start generating random numbers. By default, the generator uses the current system time as the seed, which ensures that different random sequences are produced each time the script is run. The seed() method can be used to explicitly set the seed value. By setting a specific seed, the random number generator produces the same sequence of random numbers every time the script is executed. This makes the process reproducible and ensures consistent results, which is particularly useful for debugging, testing, or replicating simulations. Without setting a seed, the output of the random process will vary each time it is run.

## Instructions

The homework for this Computer skills practical is divided into 5 questions for a total of 100 points. First, fork this repo and make sure your fork is made **Public** for marking. Answers should be added to the # INSERT ANSWERS HERE # section above in the **README.md** file of your forked repository.

Questions 1, 2 and 3 should be answered in the **README.md** file of the `logistic_growth` repo that you forked during the practical. To answer those questions here, simply include a link to your logistic_growth repo.

**Submission**: Please submit a single **PDF** file with your candidate number (and no other identifying information), and a link to your fork of the `reproducible-research_homework` repo with the completed answers (also make sure that your username has been anonymised). All answers should be on the `main` branch.

## Assignment questions 

1) (**10 points**) Annotate the **README.md** file in your `logistic_growth` repo with more detailed information about the analysis. Add a section on the results and include the estimates for $N_0$, $r$ and $K$ (mention which *.csv file you used).
   
2) (**10 points**) Use your estimates of $N_0$ and $r$ to calculate the population size at $t$ = 4980 min, assuming that the population grows exponentially. How does it compare to the population size predicted under logistic growth? 

3) (**20 points**) Add an R script to your repository that makes a graph comparing the exponential and logistic growth curves (using the same parameter estimates you found). Upload this graph to your repo and include it in the **README.md** file so it can be viewed in the repo homepage.
   
4) (**30 points**) Sometimes we are interested in modelling a process that involves randomness. A good example is Brownian motion. We will explore how to simulate a random process in a way that it is reproducible:

   a) A script for simulating a random_walk is provided in the `question-4-code` folder of this repo. Execute the code to produce the paths of two random walks. What do you observe? (10 points) \
   b) Investigate the term **random seeds**. What is a random seed and how does it work? (5 points) \
   c) Edit the script to make a reproducible simulation of Brownian motion. Commit the file and push it to your forked `reproducible-research_homework` repo. (10 points) \
   d) Go to your commit history and click on the latest commit. Show the edit you made to the code in the comparison view (add this image to the **README.md** of the fork). (5 points) 

5) (**30 points**) In 2014, Cui, Schlub and Holmes published an article in the *Journal of Virology* (doi: https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00362-14) showing that the size of viral particles, more specifically their volume, could be predicted from their genome size (length). They found that this relationship can be modelled using an allometric equation of the form **$`V = \alpha L^{\beta}`$**, where $`V`$ is the virion volume in nm<sup>3</sup> and $`L`$ is the genome length in nucleotides.

   a) Import the data for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses taken from the Supplementary Materials of the original paper into Posit Cloud (the csv file is in the `question-5-data` folder). How many rows and columns does the table have? (3 points)\
   b) What transformation can you use to fit a linear model to the data? Apply the transformation. (3 points) \
   c) Find the exponent ($\beta$) and scaling factor ($\alpha$) of the allometric law for dsDNA viruses and write the p-values from the model you obtained, are they statistically significant? Compare the values you found to those shown in **Table 2** of the paper, did you find the same values? (10 points) \
   d) Write the code to reproduce the figure shown below. (10 points)
